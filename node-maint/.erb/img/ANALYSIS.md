# arken/packages/node/.erb/img/ANALYSIS.md

## Folder purpose in project context
Holds static branding images used by template/docs surfaces for `@arken/node`.

## Notable files and responsibilities
- `logo.png`: high-resolution project logo used in package README header rendering.

## Protocol / test relevance
- No direct protocol/runtime ownership; primarily documentation/scaffolding UX impact.

## Risks / gaps
- Asset replacement without dimension/contrast checks can degrade README and scaffold visual fidelity.
- No explicit optimization/size policy documented for static asset updates.

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Add a brief asset update guideline (format, max size, expected usage) if branding assets change frequently.
