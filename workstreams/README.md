# arken/workstreams/README.md

Use this folder for larger scoped initiatives that need design + research + iterative implementation.

## Standard structure
- `workstreams/<topic>/CHECKLIST.md` — actionable checklist
- `workstreams/<topic>/RESEARCH.md` — external product/industry research notes
- `workstreams/<topic>/ARCHITECTURE.md` — design, tradeoffs, data model, API boundaries
- `workstreams/<topic>/TASKS.md` — chunked implementation plan and status

## Example topics
- `matchmaking-system/` (compare Steam/Battle.net-like systems, queueing, ranking, party constraints, anti-abuse)
- `storefront-catalog/`
- `patch-delivery/`
- `identity-and-social/`
